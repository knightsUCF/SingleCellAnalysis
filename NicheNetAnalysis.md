# NicheNet

<h3>What NicheNet Can Predict</h3>

1) which ligands from one cell population (“sender/niche”) are most likely to affect target gene expression in an interacting cell population (“receiver/target”)

2) which specific target genes are affected by which of these predicted ligands

<i>Check that the research paper already filtered out the ligands: So, you need to have a clear set of genes that are putatively affected by ligands from one of more interacting cells.</i>
