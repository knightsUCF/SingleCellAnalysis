<h3>What NicheNet Can Predict</h3>

1) which ligands from one cell population (“sender/niche”) are most likely to affect target gene expression in an interacting cell population (“receiver/target”)

2) which specific target genes are affected by which of these predicted ligands

<h3>Defining Gene Set of Interest</h3>

<i>"These are the genes in the “receiver/target” cell population that are potentially affected by ligands expressed by interacting cells</i>
