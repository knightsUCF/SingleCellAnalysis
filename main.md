# Overview

Single cell analysis aims to analyze the frequency of gene groups in a cell. In the case of a cell injury, we can detect which genes seem significant in the regeneration process.

The following data and methods are based on the research paper:

```R

library(dplyr)
library(Seurat)
library(patchwork)


path = '../Data/Original/'
pbmc.data <- Read10X(data.dir = path, gene.column = 1)
pbmc <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = pbmc.data, project = "SC", min.cells = 3, min.features = 200)


# The [[ operator can add columns to object metadata. This is a great place to stash QC stats
# pbmc[["percent.mt"]] <- PercentageFeatureSet(pbmc, pattern = "^MT-")

# Visualize QC metrics as a violin plot
plot(VlnPlot(pbmc, features = c("nFeature_RNA", "nCount_RNA", "percent.mt"), ncol = 3))
```
